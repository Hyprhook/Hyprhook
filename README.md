  <p align="center">
    Hyprhook is a plugin for Hyprland that allows you to run scripts when specific events occur. It acts as a proxy to make event information available outside of C++ code, passing relevant data as JSON parameters to your scripts.

## Installation

### Manual

To build the project, ensure that the Hyprland headers are installed on your system. Then, navigate to the repository directory and run:

```fish
make all
```

Then use `hyprctl plugin load` followed by the absolute path to the `.so` file to load, you could add this to your `exec-once` to load the plugin on startup

### Hyprpm

```fish
hyprpm add https://github.com/Hyprhook/Hyprhook
hyprpm enable Hyprhook
```

### Nix

Refer to the [Hyprland wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Nix/Hyprland-on-Home-Manager/#plugins) on plugins, but your flake might look like this:

## Configuration

To configure Hyprhook, specify the script directories for each event in your Hyprland configuration file. When an event occurs, the corresponding script will be executed with the event data passed as a JSON parameter (if applicable). The available keywords are the names of the events as listed in <a href="#json-parameters">JSON Parameters</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The event 'submap' is called 'onSubmap' in the configuration file.

Example configuration snippet:

```ini
hyprhook {
  activeWindow = /path/to/your/script.sh
  openWindow = /path/to/another/script.sh # Add more event-script mappings as needed
}
```
> [!NOTE]
> Ensure your scripts are executable and include the appropriate shebang (e.g., `#!/bin/bash` for Bash scripts). If your scripts do not execute as expected, verify that they have execute permissions and that the shebang matches the script's interpreter.

## JSON Parameters

The plugin uses the following functions to generate JSON parameters for each event:

- `Submap Data`: Returns a json with the attribut submap for the submap name changed to.
- `Window Data`: Returns JSON for a window like with `hyprctl activeWindow -j`.
- `Workspace Data`: Returns JSON for a workspace like with `hyprctl activeWorkspace -j`.
- `Monitor Data`: Returns JSON for a monitor like with `hyprctl monitors -j` but for one monitor only.
- `Vector2D Data`: Returns JSON for a `Vector2D` object with x and y values.
- `SButton Data`: Returns JSON for a button event (`IPointer::SButtonEvent`).
- `SDown Data`: Returns JSON for a touch down event (`ITouch::SDownEvent`).
- `SUp Data`: Returns JSON for a touch up event (`ITouch::SUpEvent`).

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to know how the json looks like you can always set the script to be run to `echo` and see the output.
